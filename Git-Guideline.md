# Git Guideline

When you first open this repository, click **“**Code**”**

And then copy the HTTPS URL

Open terminal

Navigate to the location where you want to place the repository using the **cd** command.

At the preferred location, enter **“git clone <URL>”**

After cloning is complete, you can see that the local repository has been created. Go to the

repository with the **cd** command.

The local repository will be your primary workspace.

The main branch is not a workspace, and each member has to work in their own branch.

The way to move a branch is **“git checkout <branch name>”**.
  
  

**IMPORTANT** Always work in your own branch

The way to check which branch I am currently in is **"git status"** or **"git branch"**.
  
  

**IMPORTANT** Before start working, make sure you pull from the main branch so that you are

up to date with the main branch.

**“git pull origin main”**
  
  

You are free to make any commits on your branch. Here's how to commit:

**"git add ."**

**"git commit -m "commit message""**

**"git push"**
  
  

When some work is completed, make a pull request to the main branch.
  
  

There will be a lot of merge conflicts. I suggest using VScode. There are lots of tools you can

use to resolve the merge conflict. Make sure you compare the code line by line when

you merge them.
