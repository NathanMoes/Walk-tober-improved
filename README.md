# Walktober
Walktober is a yearly fitness challenge at PSU. And PSU is currently using software called ChallengeRunner for Walktober. This Capstone project will design and implement a new, better software platform for Walktober. The system should support all of the basic features of the current platform but also have more modern look and feel, single responsive web app that can be used on a desktop, laptop, or mobile device, streamlined and focused on the Walktober event, improved design, graphics, and branding, better controls, analytics, and generally more fun for the participant, simpler admin configuration that is more focused on how PSU runs Walktober, and backend reports.
