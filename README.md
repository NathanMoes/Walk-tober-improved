# Walktober
Walktober is a yearly fitness challenge at PSU. And PSU is currently using software called ChallengeRunner for the Walktober event. This Capstone project will design and implement a new, better software platform for Walktober. The system should support all of the basic features of the current platform but also have a more modern look and feel, a single responsive web app that can be used on a desktop, laptop, or mobile device, streamlined and focused on the Walktober event, improved design, graphics, and branding, better controls, analytics, and generally more fun for the participant, simpler admin configuration that is more focused on how PSU runs the Walktober event, and backend reports.

## Getting started
First, download and install the latest Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ko/)

And then install the Ionic CLI with npm:

```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in package name.

```bash
$ npm uninstall -g ionic
$ npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

And then clone this repository to your desktop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juroc95/walktober.git
```

And then move to the project repository and install all the required packages

```bash
$ cd walktober
$ npm install
```
## Firebase CLI installation

To download and install the Firebase CLI run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

## Run the app
The majority of Ionic app development can be spent right in the browser using the ionic serve command:

```bash
$ ionic serve
```
